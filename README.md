Thanks to [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) and Github, I managed to build and host [shadowsocks-libev](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-libev) builds for [TomatoUSB](http://tomatousb.org/)-based ROM(eg., [Asuswrt Merlin](https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin), [Tomato by shibby](http://tomato.groov.pl/)) continuously.
