# Prebuilt shadowsocks-libev for tomato-based router.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xc2/shadowsocks-libev-tomato.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xc2/shadowsocks-libev-tomato)

Thanks to [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) and Github, I managed to build and host [shadowsocks-libev](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-libev) for [TomatoUSB](http://tomatousb.org/)-based ROM(eg., [Asuswrt Merlin](https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin), [Tomato by shibby](http://tomato.groov.pl/)) continuously.

## Shut up and give me the link

You can get the prebuilt binaries from [Release](https://github.com/xc2/shadowsocks-libev-tomato/releases) page of this repository.
